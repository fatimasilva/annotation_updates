### <a name=activities>Activities since last conference call (Feb 2015)</a>

#### Manual annotation and UCs
[Summary of annotation updates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10VPiZekkTSfYrkVRVCSUQ2tFxwttu-9C1mYgCf6wjv4/edit?usp=sharing) (googledoc)

See GeneDB rss for a log of all the changes:

* [Tb927](http://www.genedb.org/rss/Tbruceibrucei927/since/4/months)
* [Tbg972](http://www.genedb.org/rss/Tbruceigambiense/since/4/months)

#### **Submission of GO terms to GOC**
We are submitting annotation to GOC every six months, last submission was in March (Loaded and available at GOC and UniProtKB)

#### **Added UniProtKB mappings to Tb927**
Available at GeneDB, will be loaded in future releases of TriTrypDB

#### **Added domain based product description for hypothetical proteins**
Products based on Pfam domain hits where added to ~1200 hypothetical proteins (available at GeneDB and in next release of TriTrypDB).

#### **Updated functional annotation in next release of TriTrypDB (GeneDB version: May 2015)**
Functional annotation updates (products, names, GO terms and EC numbers) will be available in TriTrypDB 25 (last updated on Nov 2014).

#### **Curated datasets**
* _T. brucei_ acidocalcisomes proteome: Proteomic analysis of the acidocalcisome, an organelle conserved from bacteria to human cells. [PMID:25503798](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25503798)

#### **Pseudogene annotation tool**
Working with Sascha to add pseudogene prediction to the annotation pipeline.

### <a name=pending>Pending/Working on</a>

#### **Update of Tb927 5'UTRs**
Using mainly the new splice leader transcriptome data from [Jensen et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25331479) already loaded in TriTrypDB.

#### **Current backlog of User Comments in _T. brucei_**
* 1443 unique UCs to be reviewed and added to the annotation (related to 2923 genes). See [googledoc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10VPiZekkTSfYrkVRVCSUQ2tFxwttu-9C1mYgCf6wjv4/edit?usp=sharing) (4 last columns)

#### **Datasets**
* Tb927 mitochondrial outer membrane proteins: _Mitochondrial outer membrane proteome of Trypanosoma brucei reveals novel factors required to maintain mitochondrial morphology_. [PMID:23221899](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23221899)

#### **Improving product descriptions of hypothetical proteins** 
Adding product descriptions to hypothetical proteins based on domain predictions. Will be extended to Tbg972 and the other trypanosomes.
